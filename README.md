# Vaccine Demand Prediction Project

## Project Overview
The Vaccine Demand Prediction Project is designed to predict vaccine demand across categories such as **high demand**, **medium demand** and **low demand** using a machine learning pipeline. This is to aid in local production of vaccines for high demand areas. 
It integrates **data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and retraining**, supported by a **FastAPI backend** and evaluated under stress using **Locust flood request simulations**.
